## Part 1: App Description

> My app is my own implementation of the arcade game "Snake". 
> The rules of the game are simple. You move the snake around with the 4 arrow keys,
> and you try to grow your snake as big as possible by eating apples, which are the red
> squares found in the board. The snake is green. If the snake touches itself or if it leaves
> the boundaries, then the game is lost.

## Part 2: New

> Something new I learned from this project was all the different methods that can be given to nodes.
> In this project I learned how to color nodes, and how to give nodes effects. I learned a 
> lot more on how to design good looking GUI. I also learned about games and how they
> are made in java. I learned that every game must contain some sort of game loop.
> I am sure I will use the code in Game.java in my other java projects in the future.


## Part 3: Retrospect

> I think if I were to start this project over I would do more commits and make more use of Git. 
> I did not do many commits, and my workflow for this project was very unorganized which caused a lot
> of unnecessary time figuring how to accomplish a task.
